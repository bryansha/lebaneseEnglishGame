words Version 0.1.1 Change Log:

Added a study set keyword that adds the word pair into a new dictionary.

Added multiple new keywords

Gave option to choose between study set and random words.

If the user chooses random words it continues like normal using the same formatting structure used for specifying the language given.

If the user chooses study set then the loop will not run the main while loop but instead will run a different
while loop that is the same except that its reading and writing another new dictionary and txt file.

added a 'remove from study set' command

move top instructions for remove clear all ect into a new line that says.

IMPORTANT: type -commands for special functions.

Many other non listed improvements.
